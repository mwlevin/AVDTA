\chapter{Introduction}

AVDTA is a research software for studying DTA and mesoscopic simulation models of autonomous vehicle technologies.
%
AVDTA extends the typical kinematic wave theory mesoscopic models of simulation-based DTA by adding a number of revised models based on CAV technologies. These include the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiclass cell transmission model where the fundamental diagram changes in space and time\cite{levin2016multiclass}
	\item Dynamic lane reversal\cite{levin2016cell, duell2016system}
	\item Conflict region model of reservation-based intersection control\cite{levin2015intersection, levin2015optimizing}
	\item Backpressure and $P_0$ policies for reservation-based intersection control
	\item Dynamic transit lanes
\end{itemize}

The purpose of this documentation is to explain the user interface and input data formats. The user interface contains two parts: a control interface that can modify all network, transit, and demand data and run DTA, and an editor that can visualize the network and modify individual nodes and links. For software development, see the javadocs of the API.

\section{Contributors}
Most software development was by Michael W. Levin. Sudesh Agrawal contributed to calibration and testing of the conflict region model and cell transmission model. Josiah P. Hanna and Guni Sharon contributed to microtolling analyses.
