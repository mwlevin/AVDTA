\section{Distribution}
AVDTA is a research software for studying DTA and mesoscopic simulation models of autonomous vehicle technologies. AVDTA is not available for commercial use. AVDTA may not be used without the permission of Michael W. Levin.

AVDTA extends the typical kinematic wave theory mesoscopic models of simulation-based DTA by adding a number of revised models based on CAV technologies. These include the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Multiclass cell transmission model where the fundamental diagram changes in space and time\cite{levin2016multiclass}
	\item Dynamic lane reversal\cite{levin2016cell, duell2016system}
	\item Conflict region model of reservation-based intersection control\cite{levin2015intersection, levin2015optimizing}
	\item Backpressure and $P_0$ policies for reservation-based intersection control
	\item Dynamic transit lanes
\end{itemize}
