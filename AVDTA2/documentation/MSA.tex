\chapter{Dynamic traffic assignment}

The purpose of AVDTA is to solve DTA with AVs, and the ``DTA'' tab contains options for loading and creating assignments. (An \textit{assignment} determine the route each vehicle takes.) Currently, AVDTA uses the method of successive averages to find an UE assignment. 

When a project is opened, no assignment is loaded by default. The \texttt{assignments} folder contains all previously stored assignments. Every time MSA is run, AVDTA will store the last iteration as a new assignment. Assignments are created with a random number as the name. However, assignments can be renamed as follows: Each assignment is a subfolder in the \texttt{assignments} folder. Renaming the subfolder will rename the assignment.

The AVDTA GUI provides a list of all existing assignments:

Selecting an assignment will fill the text area on the right with some summary statistics.

Clicking ``Load assignment'' will assign vehicles to the selected assignment.

Options to run MSA are on the right hand side. The starting iteration controls the initial step size ($\lambda=\frac{1}{i}$). When working with a previous assignment, it may be helpful to start at a lower step size. The stopping criteria are the maximum number of iterations and minimum gap. If either is reached, MSA will stop.

The status bar will estimate the completion and remaining time, based on computation time for previous iterations and the stopping criteria of the maximum number of iterations.
